# Shape_Generator

A shape generator is a tool or program that allows users to create various shapes and designs digitally🎨🔧.

⬤ A shape generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) is a small project that allows you to create and manipulate basic shapes like circles and rectangles on a web page. It utilizes the Canvas element in HTML to draw and display these shapes dynamically.

⬤ The project typically involves writing HTML to create a "CANVAS" element, which serves as a blank drawing area. CSS is used to style the canvas and control its appearance, such as setting its dimensions and background color. JavaScript is then used to interact with the canvas and draw the desired shapes.

⬤ Shape generators typically offer a variety of predefined shapes such as rectangles ▭, circles ⭕, triangles △, polygons 📐, and more. Users can adjust the parameters of these shapes, such as size, position, rotation, and color, to create customized designs. Some shape generators also provide advanced features like gradients 🌈, textures 🖌️, and special effects ✨ to enhance the visual appeal of the shapes.

⬤ The result is a visual representation of the shapes rendered on the web page. Users can experiment with different inputs or settings to create and modify shapes dynamically. The project can be hosted on GitHub 🐙, a popular platform for hosting and sharing code, making it accessible for others to view, contribute to, or use as a learning resource.

   In summary, a shape generator using HTML, CSS, and JS on GitHub is a simple web-based project that lets you draw and manipulate shapes like circles 🟠 and rectangles ▢ by utilizing the Canvas element 🖌️ and writing code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
